<p><i><b>Starting Out with Python discusses
control structures, functions, arrays,
and pointers before objects and classes.
As with all Gaddis texts, clear and
easy-to-read code listings, concise and
practical real-world examples, focused
explanations, and an abundance of exercises
appear in every chapter.</b></i></p>
