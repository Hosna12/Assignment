<p><i><b>Starting Out with Python discusses<br>
control structures, functions, arrays,<br>
and pointers before objects and classes.<br>
As with all Gaddis texts, clear and<br>
easy-to-read code listings, concise and<br>
practical real-world examples, focused<br>
explanations, and an abundance of exercises<br>
appear in every chapter.</b></i></p>
